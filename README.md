## Diabetes
Diabetes is a serious medical condition when your body has problems with regulating blood sugar (glucose), therefore, blood glucose level is too high. Insulin is the key component in the process of this regulation. The main problem with diagnosing type 2 diabetes is that symptoms develop slowly over the years and you can notice them when itâ€™s too late to prevent the disease.
